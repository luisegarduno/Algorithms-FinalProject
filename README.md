**CS 3353 – Spring 2020**

**Project 4 (The Last One) + Exam 2 Replacement Project**

As part of HW 2 and HW 3, you’ve researched a particular algorithmic problem and solutions to
that problem. And, you’ve explored modern applications of those algorithms. It is fairly likely
that at some point in the future, you will be asked to interview for some type of position in an
online environment – maybe some of you have had to do this already.

<u>**Scenario:**</u>

You’ve applied to a company and they are interested in you for an entry-level software
development position. Part I of the interview of this company is for them to assess your abilities
as an autodidact. Assume that the company has assigned you the algorithmic problem area that
you’ve worked on in HW 2 and HW 3. Here’s the guidance they give you for Round I.

**Your task for Round I is to demonstrate to management that you can quickly get up to speed
in a new area. Using the algorithmic problem previously discussed, produce a short video
not to exceed six (6) minutes that communicates the following:**
- **A brief introduction to the problem.**
- **Describe the baseline solution (trivial solution) and one solution that is better than
the trivial solution**
- **Provide a walk through and demonstration of implementations of your trivial
algorithm and your more optimal algorithm. The code should be of the highest
quality, and the demonstration should clearly show that the “better” algorithm is
indeed faster than the trivial solution when applied to the same data set.**

**Please submit the source code as part of a public Github repository and ensure that it builds
in the Github Actions Linux virtual environment. Information will be forthcoming about
video submission.**

I’m not going to be more specific than that. I want you to channel everything you’ve learned
about coding and algorithms plus professional technical communications into this.

Here is how the deliverable breaks down between Project 4 and Exam 2 Replacement:

**Project 4: The Technical Mastery and Implementation**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your score on Project 4 will be based upon your demonstrated mastery of the technical
aspects of this project plus your implementation code and examples.

**Exam 2 Replacement Project: Communication of your Technical Expertise**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your score on the Exam 2 Replacement Project will be based on the clarity of your
explanation of the problem space and demonstration of the example. I will not consider the
technical correctness of your implementation for this part. In other words, if you make some
mistakes in mastery of the algorithm or in your coding examples, that will be covered under
Project 4.

**Both parts are due May 4 by 11:59 pm.**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Video will be uploaded to Box and you’ll provide a link.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You’ll provide a link to the public Github repo
